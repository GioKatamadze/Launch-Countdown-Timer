## My process

1. Change background color of body
2. Add background images
3. Create wrapper div
4. Add icons and text
5. Give icon sizes and styles in CSS
6. Create hover effects for buttons and links
7. Add Javascript code to create flipping timer

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile first approach
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

While working on this project I gained more practise of Vanilla Js, the main challenge that I overcame was to create Js Functionality for the timer. After research and practicing different ways for resolving this step, I wrote the Js code, that worked eventually and it gave me some confidence and knowledge of making wabsites interactive and dynamic.

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic, interactive and functional projects
